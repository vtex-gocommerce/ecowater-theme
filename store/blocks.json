Sleeping happens naturally to reset our body for another day. When we’re dehydrated, we don’t go for another iced coffee, we turn on the faucet to receive water.</p>  <p>But how likely are you to replenish yourself if your home’s water smells like rotten eggs? </p> <p>It’s a problem that can occur with no warning. Water that smells can have a negative impact on our drinking and personal hygiene habits. Here are a variety of different scents you may be smelling out of the faucet:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Sewage</li>     <li>Musty</li>     <li>Sulfur</li>     <li>Metal</li>     <li>Fishy</li> </ul> <p> So why does your water smell? Let’s investigate and dive into the causes and solutions to these smelly water issues. </p> <h2>1. My Water Smells Like Sewage</h2> <figure>     <img src=\"http://ecowaterqa.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/155503\" /> </figure> <p>When the aroma of dirt, grime and waste strikes your water supply, the smell can be appalling and insufferable like a busy city street after heavy rainfall. But your water supply doesn’t need to be clogged like the city’s sewage system.</p> <p>The sewage smell you’re experiencing can be <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/sourcesofwaterpollution.php#.W4leXpNKhTY\">caused by several factors</a>. It could be the bacteria left by food and soap in your drain. The scent from the bacteria is actually a gas that originates in the drain and makes its way up to the faucet resulting in your water acquiring a dirty smell. </p> <p>Another reason your water smells like sewage could be the hot water heater’s temperature is too low. Were you away from home for a long period of time and shut it off in fear of pipes bursting? The smell could be originating from the bacteria that harvested itself in the lower temperatures while the hot water heater was turned down. The bacteria isn’t harmful to you, but the smell can become quite pungent.  </p> <p>Another cause could be the result of hydrogen sulfide entering the water supply. This gas can actually hurt you by causing nausea, headaches, delirium and convulsions.  </p> <h3>What you should do</h3> <p>First, grab a glass of water from the faucet while plugging your nose. Walk away with the water in hand, then take a whiff once you’re in another room. If the water smells normal, the odor is coming from bacteria build-up in your drain. </p> <p>To remove the smell emanating from your drain, pour ¼ cup of baking soda down the drain followed by ¼ cup of white vinegar. It’s going to bubble, but let this continue for 10 minutes. While you wait, boil a pot of water on the stove and then pour it into the drain. This will disinfect your pipes and <a href=\"https://homeguides.sfgate.com/rid-smells-sink-28092.html\">remove the foul odor</a>.</p><p>If your water still smells after you’ve removed yourself from the source, try turning up the temperature in your water heater for 24 hours. Run hot water through your pipes frequently during this timeframe to flush the water’s mode of transportation.  </p><p>If the smell persists, you need to contact your local water testing lab. They can test the water for contaminants and detect hydrogen sulfide.  </p> <p>EcoPureHome also offers a solution to water that smells like it’s coming from a sewer. The <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/ecopure-pivotal-whole-home-filtration-system/p\">EcoPure Pivotal Whole Home Filtration System</a> is a proven water filtration system for treating water problems. It can chase away the sewage smell and keep your water smelling like nothing at all.     </p><h2>2. My Water Smells Musty</h2> <figure>     <img src=\"http://ecowaterqa.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/155504\" /> </figure> <p>Your water should smell fresh, not damp and aged like it’s been sitting in your basement for a week. While your water certainly doesn’t smell like mold, a musty scent could faintly resemble just that. </p><p>If your water smells musty, it could be from erosion in your water pipes. The metal decaying from the pipes could affect the smell. Generally, the smell is the worst thing that can happen if your water is musty. But if it lingers and becomes stronger, a bigger problem may be on your hands. </p><h3>What you should do</h3><p>If you can’t stand the musty scent any longer, it’s time to invest in a quality water dispenser with a <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/whirlpool-ultraease-reverse-osmosis-filtration-system/p\">filtration system</a>. A filter can catch the erosion coming from aging water pipes. This will leave your water free from additional sediments.</p> <h2>3. My Water Smells Like Sulfur</h2> <figure>     <img src=\"http://ecowaterqa.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/155505\" /> </figure> <p>If your water smells like rotten eggs, not only will it be too pungent to enjoy, but we strongly recommend you don’t even think about drinking it. </p><p>Your water smells like sulfur because of the presence of sulfur bacteria or hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur bacteria thrives in oxygen deficient environments such as plumbing systems. The bacteria then feasts on decomposing organic matter. This leads to the creation of hydrogen sulfide, which becomes trapped in the plumbing system. </p><p>Sulfur bacteria alone is not a threat to your wellbeing. But it promotes the growth of other harmful materials such as iron bacteria that can clog wells, plumbing and irrigation systems. Elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide from sulfur bacteria can make you extremely sick and cause nausea and convulsions.</p><h3>What you should do</h3><p>If the smell is only coming from warm water out of the faucet, it’s most likely your water heater. If this is the case, contact a water system professional to replace your magnesium anode. This attachment is connected to a plug on top. Replacing the original anode rod may cut the production of hydrogen sulfide gas at the source. However, the rod’s removal will most likely decrease the life expectancy of your water heater. </p><p>You can also use a chlorine bleach solution to flush the water heater. Increasing the temperature in the water heater can also help remove the bacteria. Both of these solutions can be tricky, so always proceed with caution. We strongly recommend you consult with the manufacturer and get a professional to help you. </p><p>If the smell occurs when both warm or cold water is running, it could be coming from one of these three sources:</p><p>EcoPureHome offers a handful of solutions to fix these problems with a <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/water-softeners/water-softening-systems\">water softener</a>. Consider the amount of water you and your family uses and check the amount of space you have available for these systems. You can kick the smell of rotten eggs with a new and more efficient water softener.</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Water Softener</li>     <li>Distribution System </li>     <li>Groundwater</li> </ul> <h2>4. My Water Smells Like Metal</h2> <figure>     <img src=\"http://ecowaterqa.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/155506\" /> </figure> <p>The reason your water smells like metal is because old metal piping has been slowly deteriorating into your water. Manganese, zinc, iron or copper could be rusting away over years of use. Generally, these traces of metal aren’t harmful, but they do present a less than ideal odor from your water. </p> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/what-about-lead.php#.W4lfpJNKhTY\">always a possibility that lead is in the water</a>. Most cities stopped using lead piping in the 1920s due to its toxicity. However, it took until 1986 for lead pipes to become banned in national plumbing codes. If you have a home that was built before 1986, you could be in danger. </p><h3>What you should do</h3><p>If you suspect lead is why your water smells like metal, you can request a water test from your city’s water treatment center. If the test doesn’t show there’s lead in the water but the smell endures, turn to a <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/whole-home-water-filtration/whole-home-water-filtration-systems\">filtration system</a> that can reduce the smell and taste from the water.</p><p>The metallic smell coming from your water could be a product of a low pH level. Low pH means your water is acidic, which can lead to a smell resembling metal. To balance the pH level, you may need a <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/water-softeners/water-softening-systems\">new softener</a>. The right water softener will balance your water back to a consistent pH level, leaving your water scentless.     </p> <h2>5. My Water Smells Fishy</h2> <figure>     <img src=\"http://ecowaterqa.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/155507\" /> </figure> <p>You would never drink water directly from a pond or lake. There are too many microscopic bacteria swimming around that could get you sick. If your home’s water smells fishy, the same bacteria could be infiltrating your water supply. </p> <p>Naturally occurring organic compounds could be the culprit. The compounds we’re talking about here are barium and cadmium. Barium appears naturally when mineral ore seeps into groundwater. Cadmium, while organic, enters water supplies through industry runoff such as fertilizer.</p> <p>You can also point your finger at excessive levels of chloramines. Chloramine has been used as a disinfectant to treat drinking water since the 1930s. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approves the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/chloramines-drinking-water\">use of chloramines</a>. Excessive use of this compound, however, can lead to a fishy smell from the water. </p><p>It takes a lot for these compounds to actually affect you or make you sick, so the threat level is relatively low.</p><p>The worst case scenario is that the fishy smell is coming from harmful algae blooms in the water. When this happens, residents receiving water from the infected distribution center are told <a href=\"https://www.cleanwateraction.org/features/harmful-algal-outbreaks-and-drinking-water\">not to drink, cook or bathe with the water</a>. There isn’t much you can do other than wait it out. </p><h3>What you should do</h3><p>It’s unlikely algae blooms are the reason your water smells fishy.</p> <p>If the smell persists, you should contact your water provider. They are required by the EPA to maintain the levels of organic compounds in the water supply so it’s safe to use. </p> <p>You can also go a step further and take action in your own home by installing a water filter. EcoPureHome has several options to help <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/whole-home-water-filtration/whole-home-water-filtration-systems\">filter your water</a> and chase away pungent smells preventing you from using your home’s supply.</p> <p>EcoPureHome has your back for all smelly water issues.

      "htmlBody": "<p>Over 85% of North American households live in areas with hard water. Yet many homeowners are still unsure of the effects of hard water on a house and what consequences their family may face because of it. </p> <br/> <h2>What Is Hard Water?</h2> <p>Hard water contains varying amounts of dissolved minerals like calcium, lead, and magnesium — with the very real possibility of many more. Water picks up these minerals as it trickles from its source and gets transported to your supply. The hard water level and specific minerals in your water depend on where it comes from and how long it takes to get to your home. The main reason many areas have different levels of hard water is because no supply is the same. </p> <p>Hard water can have annoying to downright detrimental effects on your home and family, no matter the level. White, chalky residue on sinks and higher utility bills from appliances working overtime are just a few signs (and costly results) of hard water. Learn how to take the best care of your home and family by understanding the level of hard water in your area and its potential costly effects on your daily life.</p> <br/> <h2>Hard Water Map</h2>  <p>Do you have hard water in your area?

Hard water may be costing you in more ways than one — learn the hard truth and then find a lasting solution. </p> <h3>Appliances: </h3> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Hard water decreases the efficiency of water heaters, dishwashers and washing machines, causing a need for more cycles and additional water and energy usage</li>     <li>Water-using appliances get worn out more quickly causing their lifespans to decrease by 30-50%</li> </ol> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Mineral buildup increases the need for constant cleaning and purchasing of additional supplies and stronger detergents</li>     <li>Run down appliances combined with the effect of hard water your on skin and hair creates an increase in purchases of laundry detergent, household cleaners, and lotions.</li> </ol> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Hard water uses 29% more energy to heat, skyrocketing electricity payments</li>     <li>Plumbing bills loom with potential bursts caused by clogs and extensive mineral backup</li> </ol> <h3>Preventing the damaging effects caused by hard water is simpler than you think.</h3> <p> Without water softeners these minerals stay in the water you use every day, causing damaging effects.</p> <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/water-softeners/water-softening-systems\">View Our Water Softening System Selection</a> </br> <h2>How Water Softeners Work</h2> <p>Water softeners are the key to cleaner dishes, brighter clothes, lower energy bills and a healthier family — especially in places with critical hard water problems. Investing in a water softener makes life easier with minimal work needed from a homeowner. </P> <p>Water softeners should be installed on a water pipeline before the water heater. After installation, the water softener will do the work for you — simply monitor salt level every 2-3 months.</p> <h3>The water softening process</h3> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Once installed, hard water enters the resin tank and flows through resin beads</li>     <li>Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap minerals in the water for the tiny sodium ions they’re holding</li>     <li>This iron exchange results in soft water that can then enter the home</li>     <li>When the resin beads have maximized their ability to hold the minerals they need to go through regeneration</li> </ol> <h3>The regeneration process</h3> <p>Minerals can not just build up in your water softener tank forever. An automated system is in place to start the regeneration process and flush minerals down a drain.</p> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Resin beads are “washed” with a highly concentrated brine solution it creates from the salt tank</li>     <li>The brine solution forces the minerals out of the resin beads and replaces them with the sodium ions</li>     <li>Once the resin beads have been recharged, the brine solution along with the minerals are flushed from the softener down the drain</li> </ol> <p>Water softeners are built to time the regeneration process without your aid. Depending on your machine, the process will occur in one of two different ways. </p> <p><b>Older machines</b> - A set timer on a predetermined schedule (i.e. every 3 days at 11pm) to regenerate no matter if the resin beads actually need it or not.</p> <p><b>Newer machines</b> - \tA computerized sensor monitors bead depletion and other metrics based on water use to regenerate only when needed. These demand-initiated regeneration softeners are ideal for saving money and energy by using less water and salt.</p> <h2> When to Refill a Water Softener</h2> <p>Generally homeowners should open the lid of their brine tank and check for a salt refill every 2-3 months. Water softeners will do the bulk of the work for you, but it’s important for you to maintain the salt levels so the machine can work properly. When a refill is needed it’s important to purchase high-quality salt pellets and fill your tank no more than half full to avoid salt bridging.</p> <h3>Key signs a tank is in need of a refill:</h3> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>The salt appears overly wet or dry</li>     <li>The tank is less than half full of salt</li>     <li>Water has started to build up</li>     <li>A salt bridge has started to form</li>     <li>Salt is sitting at the same level as the last checkup</li> </ol> <h3>What to keep in mind:</h3> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Machine age: The older the machine, the more often you must refill because older machines are not as efficient as newer models</li>     <li>Level of hard water: The harder the water in your area, the more often you must check and refill your tank</li>     <li>Size of the tank: Naturally, the smaller the tank the more often you will have to refill it</li> </ol> <p>Find a water softener to improve the quality of your family’s life and reduce the effects of hard water on your home.

      "htmlBody": "<figure>     <img src=\"http://ecowaterqa.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/155510\" /> </figure> <p>Water is the resource that makes life on earth possible, but when it contains harmful contaminants, you have a recipe for disease, malnourishment and even death. In the United States, tap water must pass federal and state regulations before it enters homes and businesses, yet some of these standards are woefully out of date.</p> <p>When a public water utility passes government-regulated tests, it doesn’t necessarily mean the water is contaminant-free; it simply means the water’s pollutants won’t cause any immediate problems. It can take years for water contaminants to cause widespread public health problems, and for this reason, it is difficult for individuals to notice problems with pollutants in their drinking water.</p> <p>In the case of water contamination, what you don’t know can hurt you. Increased cancer risks, brain and nervous system damage, fertility problems, childhood developmental issues and hormonal disruption are just a few ways contaminated water can harm the public. Most water contaminants are invisible to the naked eye, so use our guide below to identify some of the most common water contaminants, and learn how to take steps to protect yourself.</P> </br> <h2>Lead</h2> <p>Lead is a toxic metal that is extremely dangerous to consume. Water isn’t the only source of lead poisoning, but it is one of the most common. Infants, fetuses and young children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning.</P> </br> <h3>What causes it?</h3> <p>Unlike many other types of contaminants, public water usually doesn’t contain lead until it enters a building’s plumbing system. Homes built before the 1930s are especially susceptible to lead problems, because many of them feature lead pipes and/or solder. Newer homes, however, aren’t immune to lead contamination — until 2014 “lead-free” plumbing meant fixtures with 8% or less lead content. Unfortunately, fixtures with any lead content can lead to water contamination.</p> <h3>Health impact</h3> <p>The impact of lead poisoning varies greatly depending on exposure levels, a person’s health and their age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to problems with lead poisoning, so it’s important to be mindful of children’s health changes if you are a parent. </p> <p>Common symptoms:</p> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Poor appetite</li>     <li>Fatigue</li>     <li>Cramps</li>     <li>Trouble sleeping</li>     <li>Irritability</li> </ol> <p>Long-term health risks include:</p> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Hearing loss</li>     <li>Childhood growth inhibition</li>     <li>Major neurological damage</li>     <li>Organ failure</li>     <li>Coma</li> </ol> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <p>Replacing lead piping with safer materials can significantly reduce lead levels in water. Because this isn’t always feasible, utilizing a water treatment system may be the best course of action. Reverse osmosis systems, distillers and specialty filters can all help reduce lead levels in a building.</p> </br> <h2>Chlorine</h2> <p>Chlorine is best known as the chemical used to disinfect swimming pools. The distinct smell you notice after taking a dip is a result of chlorine, and many municipalities use chlorine in public drinking water to kill harmful microorganisms. While chlorine can eliminate the risk of waterborne diseases such as  cholera, dysentery and typhoid, it can also lead to health problems.</p> <h3>What causes it?</h3> <p>Chlorine is intentionally added to the water supply by the vast majority public utilities in the United States. It has been used for over a century as a disinfectant in water.</p> <h3>Health impact</h3> <p>Chlorinated water alone is unlikely to cause major health issues, but it can react with organic compounds in the water supply to produce harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as  trihalomethanes. Long-term exposure to DBPs can slow down brain activity, cause kidney and liver cancer, heart disease and even lead to death.</p> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <p>If you live in an area with chlorinated public drinking water, the best ways to remove this chemical are by utilizing a refiner, a <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/whole-home-water-filtration/whole-home-water-filtration-systems\">carbon-based filter</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/under-sink-filtration/under-sink-filtration-systems\">point-of-use filter</a>. With these types of water treatments, you will still get the disinfecting benefits of chlorine, while eliminating the unpleasant smell and associated health risks.</p> </br> <h2>Chloride</h2> <figure>     <img src=\"http://ecowaterqa.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/155511\" /> </figure> <p>A common anion in tap water, chloride typically combines with calcium, magnesium or sodium to create different types of salts. Chloride is naturally found in groundwater, but human impact has lead to higher levels in certain areas. There are no federal regulations for chloride in drinking water, as small amounts have a negligible health impact.</p> <h3>What causes it?</h3> <p>Chloride makes its way into tap water from human/animal waste, road salt storage, seawater and oil drilling operations. If your home is near any of these sources, you may notice a slight salty taste to water from your faucets.</p> <h3>Health impact</h3> <p>In small quantities, chloride in water is relatively harmless. When chloride concentrations in water exceed 250 mg/L, people with existing heart conditions may experience complications, and consumption could lead to higher blood pressure.</p> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <p>There are two main ways to remove chloride from tap water: reverse osmosis or a distiller. Both effectively eliminate the salty taste you might be getting in every sip of water.</p> </br> <h2>Iron</h2> <p>Iron is a natural element that tastes metallic in high concentrations. Small amounts of iron are safe for consumption and are, in fact, an important part of a balanced diet. In higher quantities, the taste of iron becomes more obvious. The Environmental Protection Agency provides recommendations to utilities regarding  iron concentration in water, but there are no set regulations.</p> <h3>What causes it?</h3> <p>Following precipitation or a thaw, water makes its way through soil. This is where high concentrations of iron can be found, and the passing water absorbs the substance. This process is known as seepage, and it brings a risk of contaminating the water supply.</p> <p>The other primary contributor to iron in tap water is corroding pipes. Over time, iron pipes corrode and subsequently show signs of rust. As plumping infrastructure deteriorates over time, the pipes may flake bits of iron content into passing water.</p> <h3>Health impact</h3> <p>So, is iron in water bad? Compared to many other water contaminants, iron is relatively harmless. Tap water taste is one of the most common factors people consider when deciding to get rid of the substance. If your tap water tastes a bit like a bloody lip, it may be time to treat your water. You can also spot iron by looking for water stains left behind in sinks and toilets.</p> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <p>The most effective ways to treat iron in water are with a water softener or a specialty filter. Check out EcoPure’s iron filter, a chemical-free option that features wifi-based smart home monitoring capabilities.</p> <h2>Arsenic</h2> <p>You probably already know that arsenic is not good for you. This chemical is notoriously toxic, which is why the federal limit for the substance in tap water is a mere .01 mg/L. It doesn’t take much arsenic to cause serious health problems, which is why it’s important to remove as much of the chemical as possible before water consumption.</p> <h3>What causes it?</h3> Arsenic is an element naturally found in underground rock and soil, but levels of arsenic tend to be higher near agricultural areas where pesticides are used. Because groundwater typically contains some amount of arsenic, you should be especially aware of the substance if your home’s public water supplier gets its water from underground sources. You can use the EPA’s drinking water mapping application to find the source of your local tap water.</p> <h3>Health impact</h3> <p>Long-term consumption of arsenic in water can cause a wide range of health issues. In humans, arsenic in drinking water can cause:</p> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Skin discoloration</li>     <li>Digestive issues</li>     <li>Heart, lung, nervous and reproductive system problems</li>     <li>Bladder, lung, skin, kidney and several other cancers</li> </ol> <p>Arsenic levels in tap water are measured in parts per billion (PPB). The federal limit for arsenic concentration in water is 10 ppb, but it’s best to reduce any amount of arsenic in water.</p> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <p>If you’re wondering how to remove arsenic from water at home, you should know that you have several water treatment options. Reverse osmosis, anion exchange and iron oxide filter systems are three effective approaches to arsenic removal. Compare all of your <a href=\"https://www.ecowater.com/home-water-solutions/\">water treatment options</a> from EcoPure before you attempt to remove arsenic once and for all.</p> </br> <h2>Hydrogen Sulfide</h2> <p>Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless chemical compound which is extremely dangerous in its gaseous state. In water, hydrogen sulfide poses less of a risk, but getting rid of it is a priority for anyone who cares about the taste of his or her water.</p> <figure>     <img src=\"http://ecowaterqa.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/155509\" /> </figure> <h3>What causes it?</h3> <p>How can you tell if your water is contaminated with hydrogen sulfide? The scent of your water should clue you in. If your water smells like rotten eggs, it may contain high levels of sulfur bacteria. That distinctive scent is hydrogen sulfide, the gas that certain sulfur bacteria produce in and around groundwater. While hydrogen sulfide in tap water doesn’t pose an immediate health risk, many people decide to remove it from their water due to the unpleasant taste and smell.</p> <h3>Health impact</h3> <p>Hydrogen sulfide gas is relatively harmless at the concentrations found in tap water sources, but its presence could indicate other types of pollution from sewage in the groundwater. Toxic substances such as coliform bacteria or nitrates may exist alongside the gas, and it’s important to take steps to remove them.</p> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <p>Getting rid of sulfur bacteria in water is as easy as installing a point-of-use <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/under-sink-filtration/under-sink-filtration-systems\">drinking water systems</a> or point-of entry filter. These systems will remove the unpleasant smell, taste and risks associated with the contaminant. </p> </br> <h2>Nitrates</h2> <p>While plants rely on nitrates to stay alive, they pose a significant risk to humans. Well water is especially susceptible to nitrate contamination because they may be exposed to soils with this contaminant. If you source your water from a well or you live in a rural area, take some time to learn about the risks of this harmful substance.</p> <h3>What causes it?</h3> <p>Nitrates are colorless and odorless, but they’re not harmless. While nitrates are a naturally-occuring form of nitrogen, they are used heavily in agriculture to assist with crop growth. For this reason, people who live in rural communities near farming should be mindful of nitrate levels in their drinking water. <p> <h3>Health impact</h3> <p>Infants are especially at risk for health problems associated with nitrates in water, because the substance can cause a fatal blood disorder known as methemoglobinemia or \"blue baby\" syndrome. When an infant consumes too many nitrates, their blood has more difficulty carrying oxygen throughout the body.</p> <p>In older children and adults, there has been speculation that nitrates could increase the risk of certain forms of cancer. However, there are no conclusive results on whether this is actually the case. More research is necessary to understand the full impact of nitrates in public drinking water.</p> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <P>You can eliminate up to 99% of nitrates from your drinking water with a point-of-use drinking water system or point-of entry filter. </p> </br> <h2>Bacteria and Viruses</h2> <p>There are a wide range of bacteria and viruses that can be found in water supplies. The types that carry diseases are known as pathogens, and although the EPA regulates levels of these health hazards, dangerous amounts of pathogens can enter the water supply after they leave a water treatment facility. While not all viruses and bacteria are harmful to humans, it’s not worth taking a chance on waterborne pathogens existing in your drinking water.</p> <h3>What causes it?</h3> <p>There are many sources of viruses and bacteria in water. Some of the most common include:</p> <ol style=\"list-style-type:disc\">     <li>Sewage</li>     <li>Animal waste</li>     <li>Dead and decaying animals</li> </ol> <p> These sources of microbes contaminate underground water supplies. In many cases, there are no clues or indicators that harmful viruses or bacteria are present in the water. Many people only learn that their water is contaminated after they get sick. </p> <h3>Health impact </h3> <p>There are two main microbial contaminants that the EPA monitors in drinking water:</p> <p><b>Legionella Bacteria:</b>A naturally-occuring bacteria that thrives in warm water. When water turns to steam, such as during a shower, it is dangerous to breathe in this bacteria. Inhaling the pathogen is known to cause a unique type of pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease.</p> <p><b>Enteroviruses:</b>A category of virus that lives in a host’s intestines. These viruses can cause many health problems such as meningitis. </p> <p>While these pathogens are regulated, there are others that can also cause health issues. If you suspect any problems with microbes in your drinking water, your best course of action is to switch to another water source until you install a water treatment solution. </p> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <p>The most effective way to eliminate viruses and/or bacteria in water is with disinfectant water treatment systems. There are several treatment options available <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/whole-home-water-filtration/whole-home-water-filtration-systems\">whole home filtration systems</a>, including ozone, chlorine, chloramine and UV technology. Filtration systems can also be used to eliminate dangerous pathogens from water.</p> </br> <h2>Pharmaceuticals </h2> <p>Pharmaceutical water pollution is a growing problem in the United States, as there are no federal regulations to combat the phenomena. Chemicals from prescription drugs, such as mood stabilizers or painkillers, have been found in dozens of municipal water supplies. Because most water treatment facilities don’t account for pharmaceutical contamination at all, it’s important to know about the presence of pharmaceuticals in your drinking water.</p> <h3>What causes it?</h3> <p>Traces of pharmaceutical products enter the water supply mostly due to bodily excretions. These compounds start in toilets and make their way to water treatment plants, where they are not removed. While the amount of pharmaceutical compounds in tap water is much lower than you’d find in a prescription, the safest course of action is to remove them entirely.</p> <h3>Health impact</h3> <p>Chronic exposure to pharmaceutical compounds can be detrimental to your health. Over time, pharmaceutical chemicals may cause unpredictable health outcomes, and the long-term effects of exposure are still being studied. Endocrine disruptors are of particular concern, since they disrupt many internal biological processes such as growth and development.</p> <h3>How to avoid it</h3> <p>Although it is impossible to remove all pharmaceutical compounds from drinking water, point-of-use water treatment systems can help. EcoPure’s treatment systems  <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/under-sink-filtration/under-sink-filtration-systems\">under sink filtration systems</a> have been proven to remove molecular compounds, reducing your chances of drinking water with pharmaceutical contamination. </p> </br> <h2>Find Your Water Treatment Solution</h2> <p>There are countless contaminants that can enter your drinking water, and a good portion of them will make you sick. The most important step you can take to protect yourself from waterborne pollutants is to utilize a water treatment system. There are many types to choose from, so you should tailor your purchase to the unique risks in your area. The <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/#.W4lTKNhKigw\">Environmental Working Group’s Tap Water Database</a> is a great starting point to find the specific contaminants that are a risk in your area. </p> <p>When you’re ready to find a water treatment solution, our team is here to help.</p>"

One grain is equivalent to 17.1 milligrams of magnesium or calcium dissolved into one liter of water. Soft water is lower than 1 gpg, whereas hard water is anything over 7 gpg.</p> <p>For example, a single aspirin is equivalent to 5 grains — when dissolved into a gallon of water the unit of measure would be 5 grains per gallon. Your local municipal water supply may use mg/L or ppm to measure water hardness. If so then use this calculation: 1 gpg = 17.1 mg/L or 17.1 ppm.</p> </br> <b>How do I find out my water hardness?</b> <p>You can find out how hard your water is by reviewing the annual drinking water quality report, contacting your local water municipality (if the report neglects to include a hard water rating), or by using a water test kit.</p> </br> <b>Why does soft water make my skin feel different?</b> <p>Washing your body with hard water leaves a layer of soap and minerals on your skin and in your hair. This is the underlying cause behind the “squeaky clean” or itchy feeling on your skin. Soft water can help rinse the soap completely from your skin, allowing your skin’s natural oils to surface. Soaps will also lather better in soft water so you will be able to use lesser amounts.</p> </br> <b>Is it the salt in my water that’s making my skin feel oily?</b> <p>No. Softened water helps free the healthy, natural oils in your skin which prevent you from feeling dry and irritated.</p> </br> <b>Does the salt soften my water?</b> <p>No, it is the resin bed inside the softener that is responsible for softening the water. Over time that resin becomes coated with hard particles and minerals. When that happens the softener goes into a regeneration cycle where salt in the tank is mixed with incoming water to rid the resin bed of hard particles. After regeneration the resin beds are again ready to soften your water and provide a steady stream of healthier water into your entire home.</p> </br> <b>What does the grain capacity of a water softener mean?</b> <p>Water softeners are often measured in cubic feet or grain capacity. The rated capacity of a softener is the maximum amount of grains of hard water the unit can remove prior to regeneration. </p> <p>When choosing a size you should take into account the number of people in your household, average water use per person, and hardness of your water. For the best results it’s important to know — the more people in your home and water being used, the greater the capacity your water softener should be.</p> </br> <b>What type of salt should I use?</b> <p>For the best results choose evaporated salt. Evaporated salt is the purest form of salt at 99.99% sodium chloride, and it is found in pellet form. This salt significantly reduces your chances of buildup so you will not have to clean the tank as often.</p> <p> As a general rule of thumb, higher purity salt leaves less storage tank residue, lowers the probability of salt bridging, and demands less maintenance. Other types of salt are available for specialized applications. Our water softeners use less salt than most competitive models.</p> </br> <b>What if I’m on a sodium-restricted diet?</b> <p>Water softeners using sodium chloride (salt) for regeneration add a slight amount of sodium to the water. Anyone on a sodium-restricted diet should consider this sodium as part of their overall intake. If this intake is a concern, opt for a potassium chloride (KCI) salt for regeneration or invest in a reverse osmosis drinking water system. </p> </br> <b>What is the difference between an “old” and “new” water softener?</b> <p>The difference between “old” and “new” water softeners drills down to age, design, salt efficiency, and warranty.</p> <p> <b>Age:</b> The average lifespan of a water softener is generally 10-15 years and, like any appliance, its efficiency starts to decline after years of continual use. It’s important to note if your water is abnormally hard or full of other contaminants it will wear down your appliance quicker. On the flip side, if your water is low to moderately hard it will not have to regenerate as often — possibly extending the life of the appliance a few years past the average.</p> <p> <b>Design:</b> A “two tank” softener structure is common for products with older technology. It is normal for two tank units to be engineered by separate companies at separate facilities. This results in components that do not integrate well and work less efficiently. Two tank units typically take up more floor space than newer, single tank cabinet units. Our water softeners are all single tank and designed, engineered and assembled at the same plant in the United States to ensure the highest levels of quality and accessibility.</p> <p> <b>Sale Efficiency:</b> Softeners use salt to remove the hard minerals collected during regular operation. Older softener technology uses a timer to regenerate at regular, predetermined intervals regardless of hardness consumption. These models do not properly account for varying water usage. Underestimating water usage (i.e. extra loads of laundry, guests) can lead to your softener not regenerating when it needs to. On the other hand, overestimating your water usage will result in too much regeneration, wasting water, salt, energy and money.</p> <p>Whirlpool’s new water softener technology only regenerates when needed based on your home’s water use. The use of this technology — initiated regeneration — greatly reduces the amount of water, salt and energy Whirlpool units consume.</p> <p> <b>Warranty:</b> Many older softeners offer warranties solely for parts and materials while hidden costs like trips to your home and labor are unaccounted for. Whirlpool units come with a minimum 1-year in-home parts and labor warranty (warranty varies by model).</p> </br> <b>How do I extend my full-coverage warranty?</b> <p>Water softener extended warranties can cap out at 5 years. For full warranty details, check your installation and operation manual <a href=\"https://www.ecopurehome.com/owners-manual\">here</a>.   Extend your 1-year warranty by purchasing 1 bottle of Whirlpool Water Softener Cleanser (model WHE-WSC) every 4 months and uploading your receipt to your customer account.</p> </br> <b>What makes Whirlpool water softeners more salt efficient than other models?</b> <p>Other water softeners use salt to “clean” themselves of the particles collected during the softening process. This is also known as regeneration. The amount of salt used in regeneration is called a “salt dose.” Some softeners have a defined salt dose, which means they have to be set to either “high capacity” or “high efficiency.” High capacity means the unit will regenerate less often but will use a significant amount of salt to regenerate. High efficiency means the unit uses less salt per cleaning cycle, but regenerates more frequently. No matter the setting, the unit will consume a substantial amount of salt and water. </p> <p>Our units employ a “variable salt dose” where the amount of salt used to regenerate the system varies depending on the amount of hardness it has collected. Similar to the benefits of demand initiated regeneration, the variable salt dose helps to reduce the amount of salt and water the system uses. Whirlpool units also contain exclusive technology that learns water usage patterns to employ a predictive algorithm that anticipates the level of water and hardness particles that will run through it. This feature helps the system regenerate when it is most optimal and also prevents the consumer from dealing with hard water.</p> <p>Whirlpool units are certified by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), an independent third party. Our units are certified for structural integrity, grain capacity and efficiency. Other units may be NSF certified, but they generally only carry the certification for structural integrity only, not efficiency or capacity.</p> </br> <b>Why does a softener need to recharge?</b> <p>Softeners need to recharge to rid themselves of mineral particles they collect in the resin tank during the water softening process.</p> </br> <b>How much water does each recharge use?</b> <p>Generally as much water as it takes to wash a load of laundry — it equates to about $4 per year.</p> </br> <b>How much electricity does a water softener use?</b> <p>Water softeners use as much energy as an alarm clock — it equates to less than $5 per year.</p> </br> <b>How often does my water softener recharge?</b> <p>A water softener will regenerate every 3-7 days for a typical household. All Whirlpool Water Softeners utilize demand initiated regeneration and regenerate only when needed — saving water and energy.</p> </br> <b>How long does a water softener take to recharge?</b> <p>A softener takes two hours to recharge.</p> </br> <b>What happens if the power goes out?</b> <p>Whirlpool water softeners are built with a battery-free, power interruption backup feature that maintains the clock settings for eight hours in the event of a brief power outage. If the power outage is longer the clock may need to be reset but all other settings are retained.</p> </br> <b>Does the recharged water from the softener harm my septic system?</b> <p>Whirlpool water softeners use demand initiated regeneration — their efficiency with salt usage will not overload the septic system and will not impact drain field soil percolation. An undersized septic tank or exorbitant use of cleaning products is more likely to disrupt the general operations of your septic system. </p> </br> <b>Can I install it myself?</b> <p>Yes, Whirlpool water softeners come with detailed instructions and everything needed to hook up to 1” NPT plumbing, including a bypass valve. You will need the appropriate connectors and enough tubing to connect the water softener to your existing plumbing, as well as access to a 110V electrical outlet and drain. Please refer to your installation manual or give us a call for further details.  Don’t want to install the system yourself? Professional installation for select models is available at Lowe’s. Ask your local Lowe’s associate about installation services to find out more.</p> </br> <b>Will water softeners take out iron?</b> <p>Whirlpool water softeners remove clear water (ferrous) iron from your water supply. You may not notice this iron right away because it completely dissolves into water. </p>  <p>You can see the presence of clear water iron in many places around your home — it is the reddish-brown stains on your sink or toilet and the yellow-tinged look on any water that has been sitting out. Our water softeners are equipped to remove varying levels of clear water iron to keep the rings off of your toilets, sinks and showers.</p> <p>There are currently no available water softeners capable of removing red water (ferric) iron from your supply.</p> </br> <b>Can Whirlpool water softeners be installed outdoors?</b> <p>Yes. To ensure a longer lifespan water softeners should use some type of cover to protect them from weather and damage. Notice — they should not be placed under a roofline where rain water poses a threat. </p> </br> <b>Where are Whirlpool Water Softeners built?</b> <p>They are built in Ripley, Mississippi.</p> </br> <b>Can a water softener be installed in conjunction with a Whirlpool Central Water Filtration System?</b> <p>Yes, together these units will definitely enhance the water running through your entire home. Water softeners are used to remove calcium and magnesium while central water filtration systems are used to remove sediment, chlorine, taste and odor. In combination your water will taste better and be less harmful for your home and your family.</p>"
